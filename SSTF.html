        SSTF (Shortest Seek Time First) is an abbreviation that selects the
        request which is closest to the current head position before moving the
        head away to service other requests. This is done by selecting the
        request which has the least seek time from the current head position.
      </p>

      <p class="para">
        SSTF scheduling priority is given to those processes which have the
        shortest seek, even if these requests are not the first ones in the
        queue. To implement this, the seek time of every request is calculated
        in advance in the queue and then requests are scheduled according to
        their seek time. SSTF does not ensure fairness as it can lead to
        indefinite postponement as its seek pattern tends to be highly
        localized. SSTF is like Shortest Job First (SJF) as it can prevent
        distant requests from being serviced under heavy load which can be
        termed as Starvation.

            Multiple I/O requests may arrive by different processes and only one
            I/O request can be served at a time by the disk controller. Thus
            other I/O requests need to wait in the waiting queue and need to be
            scheduled.

            Two or more requests may be far from each other so this can result
