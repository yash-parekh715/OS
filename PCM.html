        The Producer-Consumer problem is a classical multi-process
        synchronization problem, that is we are trying to achieve
        synchronization between more than one process.
      </p>

      <p class="para">
        There is one Producer in the producer-consumer problem, Producer is
        producing some items, whereas there is one Consumer that is consuming
        the items produced by the Producer. The same memory buffer is shared by
        both producers and consumers which is of fixed-size..
      </p>

      <p class="para">
        The task of the Producer is to produce the item, put it into the memory
        buffer, and again start producing items. Whereas the task of the
        Consumer is to consume the item from the memory buffer

            Below are a few points that considered as the problems occur in Producer-Consumer:
            
            The producer should produce data only when the buffer is not full. In case it is found that the buffer is full, the producer is not allowed to store any data into the memory buffer.
            Data can only be consumed by the consumer if and only if the memory buffer is not empty. In case it is found that the buffer is empty, the consumer is not allowed to use any data from the memory buffer.
            Accessing memory buffer should not be allowed to producer and consumer at the same time.
            Let's see the code for the above problem:
