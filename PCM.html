        The Producer-Consumer problem is a classical multi-process
        synchronization problem, that is we are trying to achieve
        synchronization between more than one process.
      </p>
      <p class="para">
        There is one Producer in the producer-consumer problem, Producer is
        producing some items, whereas there is one Consumer that is consuming
        the items produced by the Producer. The same memory buffer is shared by
        both producers and consumers which is of fixed-size..
      </p>
      <p class="para">
        The task of the Producer is to produce the item, put it into the memory
        buffer, and again start producing items. Whereas the task of the
        Consumer is to consume the item from the memory buffer

          <p class="para">
            The producer-consumer problem is a synchronization problem between different processes. There are three entities in this problem: a producer, a consumer, and a memory buffer. Both the producer and consumer share the same memory buffer. The producer produces some items and pushes them into the memory buffer.

            <p class="para">
              Monitors make solving the producer-consumer a little easier. Mutual exclusion is achieved by placing the critical section of a program inside a monitor. In the code below, the critical sections of the producer and consumer are inside the monitor ProducerConsumer.
